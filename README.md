Bionic reading in terminal.

## üöÄ Installation

If you have `cargo-binstall`, you can install this tool by running:

```bash
cargo binstall bio-read
```

Otherwise, you can install it from source:

```bash
cargo install bio-read
```

## üìñ Usage

```bash
$ br --help
Usage: br [-i <input>] [-f <fixation-point>] [-e <emphasize>] [-d <de-emphasize>]

Bionic reading in terminal.

Options:
  -i, --input       the file to read from. Read from stdin if not specified.
  -f, --fixation-point
                    the fixation point. Should be in range [1, 5]. Default is 3.
  -e, --emphasize   customize how to emphasize the text. The emphasized text
                    will take the place of "{}". Example: --emphasize
                    "<em>{}</em>". Default to ansi bold.
  -d, --de-emphasize
                    customize how to de-emphasize the text. The de-emphasized
                    text will take the place of "{}". Example: --de-emphasize
                    "<de>{}</de>". Default to ansi dimmed.
  -h, --help        display usage information
```

For simple usage, run `br` with the `-i` flag, which is a shorthand for `--input`:

```bash
$ br -i file.txt
```

Alternatively, pipe the text you want to read into `br`:

```bash
$ cat file.txt | br
```

To set fixation points, use the `-f` flag, which is a shorthand for `--fixation-point`:

```bash
$ cat file.txt | br -f 1
```

## üìù Note

Although this tool aims to be as close to the [original bionic reading](https://reader.bionic-reading.com/) as possible, it is not exactly the same. Notably, the behavior differs when a word is too long, and it handles special characters differently. However, this tool is open-source, and guarantees linear time complexity and and constant memory usage.

## ‚úÖ TODO

- [x] Streaming input and output (`bio_read` method of `bio_read::BioReader`)
- [x] Remove empty de-emphasized tags
- [ ] Auto detection of whether ansi styling is supported (`anstream::AutoStream`?)
- [ ] Allow overriding auto detection of ansi styling (`anstream::ColorChoice`?)
