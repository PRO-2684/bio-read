Bionic reading in terminal.

## ðŸš€ Installation

If you have `cargo-binstall`, you can install this tool by running:

```bash
cargo binstall bio-read
```

Otherwise, you can install it from source:

```bash
cargo install bio-read
```

## ðŸ“– Usage

```bash
$ br --help
Usage: br [-f <fixation-point>] [-i <input>]

Bionic reading in terminal.

Options:
  -f, --fixation-point
                    the fixation point. Should be in range [1, 5]. Default is 3.
  -i, --input       the file to read from. Read from stdin if not specified.
  --help, help      display usage information
```

For simple usage, run `br` with the `-i` flag, which is a shorthand for `--input`:

```bash
$ br -i file.txt
```

Alternatively, pipe the text you want to read into `br`:

```bash
$ cat file.txt | br
```

To set fixation points, use the `-f` flag, which is a shorthand for `--fixation-point`:

```bash
$ cat file.txt | br -f 1
```
